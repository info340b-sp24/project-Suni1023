## About
Game Finder is a web app that can help users find new games to play. Users have the ability to generate a random game or filter and search for games that matches their needs. Game Finder also lets indie developers market their games to gamers. This allows
developers to gain exposure and gamers to enjoy games that may not be on other game finder platforms.

## Features

The first feature is searching for a game. There are options for users to filter out the genre(s), supported platform(s), release year, price, and rating. A list of games would show up that match the criteria that the user selected.

The second feature is adding a game into the database. Game creators can put in the game's name, genre(s), supported platform(s), release year, and price.

Finally, the third feature allows users to bookmark games if they are interested in that game. This lets them go back and look
at it later.
