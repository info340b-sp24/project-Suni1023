# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

Group project proposal

Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").
Many people play video games, but it can often be difficult to find new games to play, especially lesser-known games made by independent developers as opposed to large companies. This makes it both difficult for gamers to expand their horizons and difficult for “indie” games to gain exposure.
Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
The gaming market is gradually approaching saturation, and it’s difficult to search for a new game that fits with their desires and preferences. Furthermore, current video games platforms and their search algorithms often fail to accurately capture and reflect users' unique preferences. The exploration queues these platforms offer are typically limited in number and feature repetitive content, making it difficult for users to discover new games they might enjoy.
Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")
There is a web app called Quantic Foundry Video Game Recommendation Engine that makes users type in three games that they have enjoyed playing. Then, they are presented with a list of games that could be fun for them, based on the games they inputted. Users can also filter out games based on the platforms that they have, release date, and niche/popular games. This web app is insufficient because their filtering system is very broad and the user experience is not that great. There are numbers on the side of the games, but it is unclear what they represent.

App Descriptions 
Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
Our user group is game lovers who may want to explore new games. Our app has incorporated games with various developers. By pushing games with diverse perspectives and cultural backgrounds, our platform can help minority groups find games that they resonate with and provide a sense of belonging. 
Currently, for the games with niche interests, the majority of video game platforms that provide video game digital distribution service and storefront might not have collected those games yet. By accessing our “add a new game” feature, people with niche interest can add their favorite games, and those newly-added games can thus be recommended to more people with similar interests.
What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are! Remember: that "viewing" information or navigating ("going to") to something isn't a feature!
With our web app, users will be able to perform three main functions: searching and filtering our game database; viewing recommendation history and bookmarking games; and adding new games, as well as reviews and ratings to existing games.
Users will be able to filter and randomly generate a game recommendation. The filters would include the supported platform(s), game genre, price, user rating, and release year. The recommendations would automatically be saved for the users to retrieve later (sorted in reverse chronological order), and users have the option to bookmark a game if they are interested. 
Users will also be able to add new games to our database, which enables both indie developers to market their games and gamers to recommend games they enjoy that are not currently in the database. Users can also add reviews to existing games, which would include a combination of a star rating and an (optional) comment about the game. 

What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
If you insist on using an API, confirm that you'll be able to access it from a client-side app by testing it at https://joelwross.github.io/cors-test/
Links to an external site.
. If you can't get data back from this testing site, then it won't work with your project.
The kind of information that the users will be viewing includes the games and associated data about them, such as supported platforms and pricing information. The below dataset provides the desired information for about 50,000 games.

How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
Remember the app doesn't need to have "business value". But as Informatics students we care about the practical usage and impacts of systems, not just their implementation. Be sure to consider that in your proposal!
In terms of the saturation of the game market and difficulties to find new games, while the current recommendation generators only have broad classifications, our filters can help users get to the more specific categories and explore the game they might be interested in. 
Currently, some independent games might not have been collected by the other platforms with game recommendation features. With our “add a new game”, we can collect a diverse range of games, allowing game developers to gain more exposure and enabling niche enthusiasts to more easily find games.
