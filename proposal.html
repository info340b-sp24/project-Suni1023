            <h2>Problems/Data Domain</h2>
            <h3>
                Overview of general problems:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many people play video games, but it can often be difficult to find new games to play, 
                especially lesser-known games made by independent developers as opposed to large companies. 
                This makes it both difficult for gamers to expand their horizons and difficult for “indie” games to gain exposure.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Information technology problem:
            </h3>
            <p>
                The gaming market is gradually approaching saturation, and it’s difficult to search for a new game that fits with their desires and preferences. 
                Furthermore, current video games platforms and their search algorithms often fail to accurately capture and reflect users' unique preferences. 
                The exploration queues these platforms offer are typically limited in number and feature repetitive content, making it difficult for users to discover new games they might enjoy.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Previous attempt:
            </h3>
            <p>
                There is a web app called 
                <a href="https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/recommendations/gamerprofile/videogame/">Quantic Foundry Video Game Recommendation Engine</a> 
                that makes users type in three games that they have enjoyed playing. Then, they are presented with a 
                list of games that could be fun for them, based on the games they inputted. Users can also filter out games 
                based on the platforms that they have, release date, and niche/popular games. This web app is insufficient 
                because their filtering system is very broad and the user experience is not that great. There are 
                numbers on the side of the games, but it is unclear what they represent.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Second part of proposal -->
        <section class="app-descriptions">
            <h2>App Descriptions</h2>
            <h3>
                Who are the users? What are the impacts on minority groups?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our user group is game lovers who may want to explore new games. 
                Our app has incorporated games with various developers. 
                By pushing games with diverse perspectives and cultural backgrounds, our platform can help minority groups 
                find games that they resonate with and provide a sense of belonging. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, for the games with niche interests, the majority of video game platforms that provide video game digital distribution service 
                and storefront might not have collected those games yet. By accessing our “add a new game” feature, 
                people with niche interest can add their favorite games, and those newly-added games can thus be recommended to more people with similar interests.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What will users interact with?
            </h3>
            <p>
                With our web app, users will be able to perform three main functions: 
            </p>

            <ul>
            <li>Searching and filtering our game database</li>
            <li>Viewing recommendation history and bookmarking games</li>
            <li>Adding new games, as well as reviews and ratings to existing games</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Users will be able to filter and randomly generate a game recommendation. The filters would include 
                the supported platform(s), game genre, price, user rating, and release year. The recommendations would 
                automatically be saved for the users to retrieve later (sorted in reverse chronological order), and 
                users have the option to bookmark a game if they are interested. Users will also be able to add new games 
                to our database, which enables both indie developers to market their games and gamers to recommend games 
                they enjoy that are not currently in the database. Users can also add reviews to existing games, which 
                would include a combination of a star rating and an (optional) comment about the game. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                The kind of information that users will view:
            </h3>
            <p>
                The kind of information that the users will be viewing includes the games and associated data about them, such as supported platforms and pricing information. 
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam/data">This dataset</a> provides the desired information for about 50,000 games.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem?
            </h3>
            <p>
                In terms of the saturation of the game market and difficulties to find new games, while the current recommendation generators only have broad classifications, 
                our filters can help users get to the more specific categories and explore the game they might be interested in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, some independent games might not have been collected by the other platforms with game recommendation features. 
                With our “add a new game”, we can collect a diverse range of games, 
                allowing game developers to gain more exposure and enabling niche enthusiasts to more easily find games.
