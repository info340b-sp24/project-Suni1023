As the ultimate techno-gladiator of the future players will take their fates into their hands battling against up to 32 other players online in action-packed frag-filled arenas.Assault Mode - Assault mode returns! Redesigned for UT2004 this fan-favorite mode sees teams face-off to defend and attack fortified bases from fast-moving trains barreling across an arid alien desert to a Skaarj mother ship poised to attack the human home world. Onslaught Mode - Onslaught mode takes team combat to the next level! Opposing teams are pitted against each other to capture and hold strategic points in order to attack and destroy the enemy power core. Taking place in massive outdoor environments here is where vehicular combat comes into its own. Flying and driving machines take combatants to the frontline and gigantic mobile battle stations serve as a platform from which to launch devastating attacks. Vehicles - Rev-up and ride out in an array of land- air- and space-based vehicles that play critical roles in a successful combat strategy in Assault and Onslaught. With vehicles ranging from single man fighters to five man behemoths Unreal Tournament 2004 provides players with plenty of choices when shopping for a mechanized implement of destruction. Levels - More than 95 maps will be available immediately including more than 45 brand new maps for all existing game play modes as well as new modes of play. Vast outdoor environments deep space combat areas and tightly packed indoor techno-arenas are all waiting for the latest entrants to the Tournament. Weapons - The entire smorgasbord of frag-dealing weaponry from Unreal Tournament 2003 returns for the experienced player to wield masterfully against new contestants. Those armaments are joined by three new implements of doom: the Mine layer which disperses spider-like bombs that chase and harass any enemy that comes within range; the anti vehicle rocket launcher or AVRiL which deals out a payload of massive rockets tuned to seek and destroy enemy mechanized units; the Grenade Launcher which launches timed explosives that will bounce on the ground and stick to enemies and enemy vehicles only to be triggered by the weapons altfire command; and the return of the notorious Sniper Rifle from the original Unreal tournament completely redesigned and upgraded to make heads roll. New Characters - Unreal Tournament 2004 introduces 32 new characters on four new teams: The human Thunder Crash lead by Tournament hero Malcolm; the Robotic Corrupt lead by an upgraded Xan Kriegor; the Iron Skull a team of merciless Skaarj warriors; and the Hellions -- wreckless human mercenaries and pirates who delight in the thrill of the kill.

The Novice setting makes the computer controlled Bots in the game move slower and inflict less damage with their attacks. For those new to first person shooters this is where teeth are cut skills are born and addiction begins... Hardcore Mode - Strap on extra armor and have a hand towel next to your mouse pad to wipe away the palm sweat. This mode is only for the pros -- all of the bots move like lightning -- dodging jumping and inflicting A LOT more damage with their standard attacks than do their Novice counterparts. Enhanced Bot AI - Bots in Unreal Tournament play as if theyre jacked up on a big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually perfected their understanding of the game rules is professorial their ability to navigate levels is GPS-like and their threat to your existence is very real. Radio Chatter - Each of the commands at your disposal in the game is accompanied by both a text message on screen AND an audio message. Pleas for back-up or for cover fire are accompanied by pre-recorded sequences communicating your needs. Making this especially cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents messages too (even if youre playing against bots cause bots are people too). New Command Line Options - For the hardcore server masters this is the dream way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want to tweak can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy! Improved User Interface - Unreal Tournament introduced a better way to see what is happening during a game. By using a unique heads up display (HUD) for each game type (Deathmatch Capture the Flag Domination and Assault) the game provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT bombarding the player with excessive info. UBrowser - Unreal Tournaments robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the need to download third-party server querying applications. Its as simple as one-two-frag. By clicking on the Play Online button and then selecting a server from the list the game is on. Spectator Cams - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be almost as much fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams gamers can enter a game and hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the level. Even cooler the camera can be attached to one of the players in the level to view the action from their perspective. Either way its a cool feature and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming. Jump Mode - Jump twice as high as normal. Its sorta like having a never-ending pair of jumpboots on. The impact these boots have on gameplay is almost indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely.(c) 2000 Epic Games Inc.
